This open source project is a repository for executable SensorML process model instances, as well as RelaxNG profiles of the core SensorML schema.

The project was initiated by the [VAST Team](http://vast.uah.edu) at the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH) but is now maintained by [Sensia Software](http://www.sensiasoftware.com) and [Botts Innovative Research, Inc](http://www.botts-inc.net).

Executable processes are meant to be executed with the process chain execution engine provided by the [SensorML Data Processing](http://code.google.com/p/sensorml-data-processing/) project.

This project also relies on the [SWE Common Data Model Framework](http://code.google.com/p/swe-common-data-framework), and the [OWS Service Framework](http://code.google.com/p/ows-service-framework) also on Google Code.
